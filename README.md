*This project was presented to a college subject at Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. Project developed by Lucas Moletta, Flávio Neto, Julio Tinti and Nithael Sampaio.*

In order for drug treatments to be successful it is essential that the patient follows the medical recommendations regarding drug intake, and their correct intake is known as drug adherence. Non-adherence to medication is a problem with repercussions that range from the danger to the lives of patients, to millionaire financial losses for governments and health systems. One way to tackle this problem in a smaller scope is to use automated medication organizers, but these are devices with a high acquisition cost. Thus, the main objective of the present work is to develop the prototype of a low-cost automated medication organizer to aid in medication adherence, with a main focus on the elderly public. 
The methodology used consists of the integration of different concepts for the elaboration of a functional prototype, which should allow the automated organization of medicines programmed by a user via a
Web application. The pillars of this integration will be Web programming, use of microcontrollers, 3D modeling and additive manufacturing. From these pillars, a mechanism was designed, driven by a servo motor and a stepper motor, which stores and separates the medicines previously placed in the device at the right times and doses. 
The 3D printing of the model, together with the control of the motors (movement mechanism) and integration with the Web App, which was done using an ESP32, validate the objective of the project, resulting in a proof of concept of an automated drug organizer with cost below the average market price. With the final prototype the user is able to eparate their medicines, program their doses, and receive them at the right time, in a safe way, with the appropriate alarms to remind them to take the pills.
